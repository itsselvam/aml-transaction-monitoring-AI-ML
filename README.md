# GRAPH-BASED TRANSACTION MONITORING USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of the Anti-money laundering in transaction monitoring process applying the proposal from the paper:
<pre><code>@article{elliott2019anomaly,
  title={Anomaly Detection in Networks with Application to Financial Transaction Networks},
  author={Elliott, Andrew and Cucuringu, Mihai and Luaces, Milton Martinez and Reidy, Paul and Reinert, Gesine},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.00402},
  year={2019}
}
</code></pre>

## Project structure and references to Open Sources projects
This implementation uses a number of the open source projects. The below list shows the ordered components, in which order the implementation is executed. 

### 1_Transaction_and_Feature_Generator
* This component is used to generate simulated transaction network (graph) with embedded anomalies (suspicious nodes and topologies). This means, the dataset used in the AML study is generated by this component. 
* The simulation logics of the generation follow the suggestion from the paper stated in the above. 
* The implementation of this component is taken from the open source GitHub repository at [Anomaly-Detection-in-Networks](https://github.com/zhangcheng1006/Anomaly-Detection-in-Networks.git)
* To run simulating the dataset, go into the directory and run the ordered processing steps in the Jupyter Notebook "1_Transaction_Simulator_and_Feature_Generator.ipynb"
